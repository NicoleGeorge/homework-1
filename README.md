First homework submission - Refactor

Project Scope:
Refactor the HoriSEOn website to; a) satisfy accissibility standards and b) optimise the site for search engines. 

Initial Refactor Process:
- I looked at the style.css file first, to familiarise myself with the styles and syntax.
- Woked my way through each section, starting with theh <nav>, then <header>, <main>, <aside> then <footer>, looking at each <section> within them.
- After I had the stuctural syntax in line with the styl.css file, each element es inspected and changed to fall in line with the style.css file.

a) Satisfy Accessibility Standards:
- alt text was needed for each img, where a detailed description was addedd in order to satisfy the accessibility requirement.

b) Optimise site for search engines:
- keywords were added to the alt text, keeping it readable, so as to not be penalised by Google. 
- added in meta tags, with website keywords and description.
- Moz was used for keywords research.
